## ‚ú® Features

* [x] **Decimal Value Control:** An input field to set a number, with "Up" and "Down" buttons to adjust the value by 0.1.
* [x] **Live Clock:** A real-time display of the current date and time that is always visible.
* [x] **Session-Based Recording:** A "Start/Stop" button to control the logging process.
* [x] **Custom Intervals:** A setting to define how often the current number is recorded (e.g., every 5 seconds).
* [x] **Timestamped Data:** Each recorded value is saved with the precise date and time of capture (`DD.MM.YYYY; HH:MM:SS; value`).
* [x] **Data Export:** The current set of recorded numbers can be downloaded as a `.csv` file with corrected name.
* [x] **Session Management:** Stop a recording and it is saved on the server without being overwritten. Users can start a new recording and the previous one is kept.
* [x] **Saved Session List:** View, rename, and download and delete previously recorded sessions.
* [x] **Keyboard Shortcuts:**
    * `ArrowUp` / `ArrowDown`: Adjust the number.
    * `Space`: Start or stop the recording.
    * `r`: Refresh list of saved sessions
* [ ] **Reminder Banner:** A non-intrusive banner appears after 61 data points have been recorded to notify the user, while recording continues.
* [ ] **Variable Resolution:** An option to change the increment/decrement value (e.g., to 0.01).

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Ideas

* [ ] **Persistent Storage:** Integrate a database (like MongoDB or PostgreSQL) or use browser local storage to save sessions permanently.
* [ ] **Data Visualization:** Add a simple chart to visualize the recorded data over time.
* [ ] **User Accounts:** Allow users to sign up and save their recording sessions to an account.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **React:** Used for building the component-based UI and managing frontend state with Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
* **Node.js & Express:** Serves as the backend for saving session data and generating CSV files for download.
* **Vite:** Serves as the modern, fast frontend build tool.
* **Bootstrap 5:** Used for its responsive styling utilities and pre-built components.
* **HTML5 & CSS3:** The foundational languages for the structure and final presentation.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps. This project contains a frontend (`/client`) and a backend (`/server`), which must be run in **separate terminals**.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/gapn/value-recorder-app.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd value-recorder-app
    ```
3.  **Set up the Frontend:**
    ```bash
    # Navigate into the client folder
    cd client
    npm install
    # Go back to the root directory
    cd ..
    ```
4.  **Set up the Backend:**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```

### Running the Application

You will need two terminals open simultaneously.

1.  **Start the Backend Server:**
    ```bash
    # In the /server directory
    npm start
    ```
    The server will be running at `http://localhost:3001`.

2.  **Start the Frontend Development Server:**
    ```bash
    # In the /client value-recorder-app directory
    npm run dev
    ```
    The application will open in your browser, usually at `http://localhost:5173`.
